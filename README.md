#  Entity Recognition Web Application


A Flask application which takes input file from user and identifies significant entities from the file and highlights them.

Abstract:

The Entity Recognition Web Application is a Flask-based system designed to assist users in identifying and categorizing significant entities within textual data. Leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of the spaCy library in Python, the application offers users a user-friendly interface to upload text files and receive highlighted entities categorized by their types.

Introduction:

In various domains such as information extraction, content analysis, and knowledge management, identifying and categorizing entities within textual data is crucial. However, manually performing this task can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we developed the Entity Recognition Web Application, which automates the process of entity recognition and categorization.

Functionality:

The core functionality of the application revolves around the identification and highlighting of entities within user-provided text files. Users can upload text files through the web interface, and the application utilizes the spaCy library to process the text and extract relevant entities. These entities are then categorized based on their types, such as persons, organizations, locations, etc.

Implementation:

The application is implemented using the Flask framework for building web applications in Python. The user interface is designed using Bootstrap, providing a responsive and visually appealing layout. The backend logic for entity recognition is powered by the spaCy library, specifically utilizing the pre-trained English language model ('en_core_web_sm').

Usage:

Upon accessing the application through a web browser, users are greeted with a simple interface displaying the application title and a file upload form.
Users can select a text file from their local system using the file upload form.
After selecting a file, users can click the "Get Entities" button to initiate the entity recognition process.
Once the processing is complete, the application displays the original text along with the highlighted entities categorized by their types.
Conclusion:

The Entity Recognition Web Application offers a convenient solution for users to identify and categorize entities within textual data. By automating the entity recognition process, the application helps streamline tasks related to information extraction, content analysis, and knowledge management. With its user-friendly interface and efficient backend processing, the application serves as a valuable tool for various text analysis tasks.

Future Enhancements:

Future enhancements to the application could include:

Supporting additional languages and language models for entity recognition.
Implementing more advanced entity linking and disambiguation techniques.
Enhancing the user interface with additional features such as entity search and filtering.
